The goal is to analyze how the synthesized version differs from the original by applying the Fourier Transform to both signals. By calculating the ratio of the wet sound's Fourier Transform to the dry sound's Fourier Transform, we obtain the transfer function, which gives insight into how the system modified the sound during synthesis. To fully understand this process, students are expected to research transfer functions, study their role in signal processing, and explore how they reveal system characteristics.
